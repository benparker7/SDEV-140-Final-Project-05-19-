# SDEV-140-Final-Project-05-19-22-
The source code for my final project for my class. It was created in Python using the tkinter framework.

This is the log-in screen for use at Albuquerque Associates: Attorneys at LawÂ®.

This GUI allows the administrator access to the company's log-in if they have the correct credentials.

In order to log-in to the system, the user needs to have the correct username key and password key. 
If the user has the correct username and password, it will open a message that says "Logging in" and 
then will exit the software after the "Ok" button or "X" button in the top right corner is clicked.

If the user does not have the correct username key and/or password key, access will not be granted to 
the user and it will open a message that says "Incorrect credentials" and will allow more attempts after 
the "Ok" or "X" button in the top right corner is clicked.

Access will also not be granted to the user if they enter nothing in the username and password field and 
it will open a message that says "No blanks allowed" and will allow more attempts after the "Ok" or "X" 
button in the top right corner is clicked.
